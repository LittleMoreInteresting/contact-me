## Inspiration
Everyone has their own inner world. We hope to create an exclusive space for everyone and allow more people to see you.

## What it does
Contact Me is an NFT, or rather your personal space, where you can Contact someone.
We hope to build it into a future space where everyone has their own territory and can connect with others.This NFT is more like a business card, allowing others to contact you.
You can mint an NFT by setting your name, email, x, etc.In the future, it will be a key to unlocking your personal space。
